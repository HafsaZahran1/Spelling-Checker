# Spelling-Checker
This repository contains a Python implementation of a spell checker class that uses a suitable data structure to store a given dictionary. The spell checker class provides three main operations: storing the dictionary, finding the nearest four words to a given input word if it is not in the dictionary, and adding a new word to the dictionary.
